ToDo:

Bugs:
- First packet has unexpected artifacts that write out to file at the end, but only 
the first packet
	- UPDATE: not just first packet, this happens randomly somwhere in the file
- Seq Num does not rollover as of now
- Does not handle SYN timeouts
- There is no lock around guessSent update

Implementation:
- Proper outputs
