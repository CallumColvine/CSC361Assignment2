Once upon a time this boy named Callum took CSC as his major. He thought it would be a good idea to take a lot of classes all related to his degree in his 4th year, so he signed up for only CSC/SENG classes. One of those classes was CSC 429. Ohhh boy Callum had no idea what was coming. This class was rough. I mean ROUGH. It was so much work, but not just work, work he hated. It was like CSC 320 all over again. Callum didn't like to write out proofs, he liked programming or thinking about things he could apply in code.
